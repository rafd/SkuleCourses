	<h2>Organisation of the Skule Courses Code Base</h2>
	<p>The following are the root directory structure of the code base.
	If it is not familiar to you, refer to the section on <a href="help_php.html">PHP and Symfony.</a></p>
	
	<h3>config</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>databases.yml</b>
			<p>The database settings are in this file. You need to change the dbname, username and password
			to your local settings, or to the staging/production server settings.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>skuleGlobal.yml</b>
			<p>This file stores all the global settings to be used in the apps. Currently, the file is split
			into three sections:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>mail_notification:</b> in the production environment of the courses app, a mail notification is sent
				every time a PHP error occurs. In both the development and production environment, a mail notification is sent
				every time a comment or exam has been submitted. Change sender/receiver parameters to suit the circumstances.</li>
				<li><b>global:</b> Currently not in use by any app.</li>
				<li><b>applet_uploader: </b>Sets the authentication for the Java Applet based multifile uploader used in adminexam by
				the courses app.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>lib</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>model</b>
			<p>This directory stores the Propel database models. The <i>om</i> and <i>map</i> directories are automatically generated
			by Propel and therefore should not be modified. All other files under this directory are inherited from the <i>base</i>
			classes and can be customized to suit the development needs.</p>
			<p>Refer to the section on <a href="help_database.html">Skule Courses Database Layer</a> if you are unfamiliar with the database organization.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>SwiftMailer</b>
			<p>This is a third party package used for sending mails through SMTP. SwiftMailer supports ttl and ssl.</p>
			<p>See <a href="help_swiftmailer.html">here</a> for a sample snippet on how to use SwiftMailer to send an email.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>functions.class.php</b>
			<p>This class only contains static methods. These methods are all used to facilitate the development of Skule Courses
			globally, serving as helper functions.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>skuleGlobalConfigHandler.php</b>
			<p>Defines how skuleGlobal.yml should be interpreted.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
