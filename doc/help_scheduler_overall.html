	<h2>SkuleScheduler High-Level Concept</h2>
	The entire project can be classed into two completely separate processes:
	<ol>
		<li><a href="help_scheduler_data.html">Data gathering</a></li>
		<li>Course filtering and decision making</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>The data for course sections and their meeting times must be gathered ahead of time
	and stored in the database to allow the filtering process to work. The data gathering
	is done by parsing the sections/meeting time data through the UT academic calendar websites.
	Because each professional school/campus has its own calendar (e.g. Engineering, Arts and Science, etc.),
	multiple parsing formats are required. The data gathering is expected to be done automatically, periodically
	and regularly.</p>
	
	<p>Assuming that the data have been properly gathered, users must be able to obtain the results
	through some filtering and displaying process. Since a user is assumed to have a core time table
	comprising of the courses that are mandatory or already chosen, it is more efficient if
	the program can filter out as many incompatible courses as possible without the inclusion
	of additional user defined constraints.</p>
	
	<p>As a result, the filtering process is separated into two components: <a href="help_scheduler_filteringserver.html">the server-side filtering</a>
	and <a href="help_scheduler_filteringclient.html">the client-side filtering</a>. The server-side filtering passes only the course data that are compatible
	with the core time table to the client-side, while the client-side filtering works in Javascript
	to meet the mutable user defined constraints.</p>
