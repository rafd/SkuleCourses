	<h2>What is Skule Courses</h2>

	<p>Originally, Skule Courses is designed to be a database of resources for the courses offered in University
	of Toronto that are of interest to the students of Department of Applied Science
	and Engineering. The resources include course critiques and a repository of past 
	exams and quizes. Skule Courses is expected to be hosted under Skule.ca.</p>

	<p>However, since the backend of the code base itself is quite generic and is suitable for a variety of
	applications for use by Skule, the code base has the potential to be expanded to include more projects
	sharing the same backend as the original "Skule Courses" project.</p>
